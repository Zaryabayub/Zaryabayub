### AGILE:

 Agile is time boxed , iterative approach to software development, to deliver the product incrementally, instead of all at once.





EPIC : What are we trying to achieve?
FEATURE:
STORY
TASKS

## Agile Scrum Roles:

###	1. Product owner:

	• understands the requirement of the customer
	• great vision for final product
	• balance is the need of other stakeholders
	• maintains the product backlog
	• release management

The product owner talks to the client and creates a backlog and then create an EPIC.

###	2. Scrum Master

	• Responsible for gluing everything together
	• sometimes act as intermediately between the product owner and dev team
	• helps in planning and breaking down work
	• managers backlog, ensures completion
	• ensures transparency

The scrum master teaches and ensures that the scrum team follows the scrum practices.

###	3. Scrum Team

	• Consists of software developers and quality assurers
	• breakdown the work into subtasks
	• deal with the planning, implementation, testing and preliminary reviewing of goals
	• Ensure timely delivery, with quality assurance
	• communicates their progress with the scrum master

Based on the guidance of the scrum master and scrum practices the scrum team will break the epic down into stories.
Further the stories would be broken down into technical tasks by the scrum team.

Example of Scrum Sprint Activities



Here each story is divided into a miniature tasks and these tasks need to be completed in short amount of time. And the work that's been done in the short time frame is called a Sprint. And that's what makes this method so efficient. By timely delivery of small features we are also ensuring the timely delivery of the whole software on the larger scale.

### What is Jira?

Jira is a project management tool and an issue tracker developed by Atlassian.
	• That is based upon the same fundamental principle which is the foundation of agile.

	 1) bug tracking and
	 2) Agile project management
	• It is an all-in-one solution for multiple software and team related use cases
